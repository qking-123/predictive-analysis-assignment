Assignment1
First of all, I loaded my datset and tried to get a general grasp of it through basic dataset functions
Then I applied transformation function over NO2 using my roll number to get z
After that I used the scipy curve_fit model to find the values for mu, lambda and c to get the best fit
initial guesses for mu=mean(z), lambda=0.01, c=1
then for visually representing said solution, I used a histogram which gives us a general idea of probability densities and overlaid it with the best fit curve to get a direct comparison of said solution with the actual distribution
